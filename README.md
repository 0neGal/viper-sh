## What is ViperSH?

ViperSH is a launcher, updater and mod manager for [Northstar](https://github.com/R2Northstar/Northstar), and not much more than that. It is similar to [Viper](https://github.com/0neGal/viper) (also made by me) however it is written in Bourne Shell, meaning it's purely CLI based, and mostly Linux only.

## Install

While ViperSH is not at all finished you can of course still download it, but currently with no documentation and with very little options. This'll be added in the future when relevant.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/0neGal/viper-sh
$ cd viper-sh
$ make install
```

To uninstall simply do `make uninstall` instead.

## Why?

Because I wanted to, and also because I wanted an alternative for myself, compared to running a program that uses 200mb of RAM just to launch or update Northstar, but overall it's mostly because I was bored and wanted to. The original Viper project is still being worked on, and this isn't me abandoning that project, this is purely a side-project.
